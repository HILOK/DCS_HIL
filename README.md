## DCS World Hold Item List

Hold Item List: A list of specific work orders that are deferred because a required part, piece of equipment, or system is missing or inoperable although a limitation might be associated with the HIL record.
Put in simple terms: DCS_HIL lets you check current status/airworthyness of your DCS aircraft before you hop in or start planning your next mission. It's the way it's done in real life.

**Why?**
because in my opinion it is preferable to know your options during planning time, i.e. what works and to what extent, instead of having to find out the hard way: over the target area after 1.5 h mission time.

**Is it realistic?**
in some way even "bugs" are. RL aircraft often have small defects that dont require immediate grounding. Pilots & maintenance crew use the manufacturer's documentation to assess, if and under which circumstances an aircraft is airworthy, before flight.

**How is this different from a bug list?**
a bug list features all things that remain to be corrected, f.ex. graphical glitches/missing textures, and things that are not in line with the real counterpart, whether or not those things are impeding functionality.

**What should go into the HIL?**
only bugs or essential features completely missing that would prevent a specific task to be performed. also a workaround, if available.
Reference: official game manual or chuck's guides (i think there is no point in browsing through real life docs, and listing everything that's missing in the game)

**How could this be done?**
obviously this can only be achieved as a group effort. 

### Formatting Rules ###
main categories (Flight Control System, Weapon System, etc.) are always listed and labeled either/or
| **unrestricted** |**`RESTRICTED`**|
| --- | --- |

sub-category items (Speedbrake, AIM-120C, etc.) are only listed, if restricted (workaround available) or inoperative (completely unusable or missing feature), and labeled as follows
|**`RESTRICTED`**|**`INOP`**|
|--- | --- |

sorting: 
- categories by priority:
- items alphabetically; except for weapon system: air-air weapons first, alphabetically, air-ground weapons next, also alphabetically (this is to allow to determine )

### Template ###
