# DCS_HIL
DCS World Hold Item List

A list of specific work orders that are deferred because a required part, piece of equipment, or system is missing or inoperable although a limitation might be associated with the HIL record.

**why?**
because in my opinion it is preferable to know your options during planning time, i.e. what works and to what extent, instead of having to find out the hard way: over the target area after 1.5 h mission time.

**is it realistic?**
in some way even "bugs" are. RL aircraft often have small defects that dont require immediate grounding. pilots & maintenance crew use the manufacturer's documentation to assess, if and under which circumstances an aircraft is airworthy, before flight.

**how is this different from a bug list?**
a bug list features all things that remain to be corrected, f.ex. graphical glitches/missing textures, and things that are not in line with the real counterpart, whether or not those things are impeding functionality.

**what should go into the HIL?**
only bugs or essential features completely missing that would prevent a specific task to be performed. also a workaround, if available.
reference: official (game) manual or chuck's guides
-> list of selected items: systems affecting flight control, performance, navigation, range (ext tanks, AAR), cold weather/night, communication, defensive, targeting, weapons (each)
-> 3 categories: unrestricted, restricted, not available

**how could this be done?**
obviously this can only be achieved as a group effort. github?
